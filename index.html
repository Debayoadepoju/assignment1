    <P><strong><u>About Me</u></strong></P>
    <p><i>I have diverse experience in retail sales, customer service and custodial management. I first started my career as a Sustainability Territory Sales Executive with Unilever, and I later joined Heineken as a Sales Team Lead where I worked for 6 years. I have also worked with Amazon and British Telecommunications. Currently I work as a custodial manager and looking to change my career as a whole by becoming a Cloud Engineer.</i></p>

    <u><strong>Why I joined Alt School</strong></u>
    </p>
    <P>
        <i>My reason for joining Alt School is not far-fetched; the world is gradually changing and embracing technology. COVID-19 was an eye-opener for all of us, as it made us realize the importance of technology. With technology, we can stay safe and continue our daily activities without overburdening state infrastructure. I hope to acquire practical skills and tools that will enable me to secure a role as a Cloud Engineer by 2024 and find success in that field.</i>
